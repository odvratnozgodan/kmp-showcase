# :core:network

This module is responsible for handling network communication and API interactions within the application. It provides a common interface for making network requests and handling responses, abstracting the underlying networking implementation.

This module might include:

* A common interface for making network requests (e.g., using Ktor).
* Platform-specific implementations of the network interface (if necessary).
* Handling of network errors and exceptions.
* Serialization and deserialization of network data.

## Dependencies

This module uses the following dependencies:

* **[Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/):** For making network requests.
* **[Kotlinx Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization):** For serializing and deserializing network data.
* **[Kotlinx Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html):** For managing asynchronous network operations.
* **`:core:common`:** For common utilities and helper functions.
* **`:core:datastore`:** For storing and retrieving network-related data (e.g., API keys, tokens).

This module uses the `com.kmpshowcase.buildlogic.multiplatform` plugin for setup.
